# LIBRARY TOUR

Library Tour is a mobile game built with React Native that randomly selects images from the Library of Congress’s Prints and Photographs API and quizzes you on the date. Three buttons appear under the image, one displaying the correct date the image was created. In addition to the game, there’s a option to browse images by search term.
